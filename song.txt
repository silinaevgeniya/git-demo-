Tether your soul to me
I will never let go completely.
One day your hands will be
Strong enough to hold me.

I might not be there for all your battles,
But you'll win them eventually.
I pray that I'm giving you all that matters,
And one day you'll say to me,

"I love my life
I am powerful, I am beautiful, I am free
I love my life,
I am wonderful, I am magical, I am me,
I love my life."

I am not my mistakes,
But God knows, I've made a few.
I started to question the angels,
And the answer they gave was you.
